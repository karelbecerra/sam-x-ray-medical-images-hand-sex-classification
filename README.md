This work includes three primary steps: **Segmentaion, Classification, and Visualization**

# Datasets
![Enhanced Hand Regions](figures/enhanced-hand-regions.png)

Datasets are available in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karelbecerra/sam-x-ray-medical-images-hand-sex-classification/

You can find notebooks ready for Kaggle and Google Colab to vizualice datasets: check **kaggle** and **google-colab** folders

# Segmentation
(documentaion in progress: how segmentaion works) 
First step is to apply segmentation (SAM) on x-ray hand images

# Classification
With different variations of segmented images we proceed to classification: 

### Training
(inprogress: description on how to training)

### Inference
(inprogress: description on how to run inference)

# Visualization
Finally applying CAMs the visualization of results

# Utils
