# Segmentation, Classification, Visualization
This work includes three primary steps: **Segmentaion, Classification, and Visualization**

## Segmentation
(documentaion in progress: how segmentaion works) 
First step is to apply segmentation (SAM) on x-ray hand images

## Classification
With different variations of segmented images we proceed to classification: 

### Training
(inprogress: description on how to training)

### Inference
(inprogress: description on how to run inference)

## Visualization
Finally applying CAMs the visualization of results
